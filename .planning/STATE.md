# Project State: Automated Personal Portfolio Website

**Last Updated:** 2026-01-18
**Status:** Planning Complete

---

## Project Reference

**Core Value:** Stack/Automation page demonstrating automated workflow (Issue → Claude PR → Review → CI → Merge → Deploy → Changelog) is the key differentiator

**Current Focus:** Roadmap created, ready to begin Phase 1 (Foundation)

**Key Constraints:**
- Privacy: No client names or sensitive metrics in public content
- Tech Stack: Next.js 16 + TypeScript + Tailwind v4 + Framer Motion + Convex + WorkOS + Vercel
- Auth Model: Email allowlist for admin-only access
- Design: Dark minimalist aesthetic (non-negotiable)
- Draft Visibility: Draft projects never appear on public pages

---

## Current Position

**Phase:** Not started (awaiting Phase 1 planning)
**Plan:** No active plan
**Status:** Roadmap approved, ready to plan first phase

**Progress:**
```
[░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░] 0% (0/66 requirements)
```

**Phase Breakdown:**
- Phase 1: Foundation (5 requirements) - Pending
- Phase 2: Public Content Pages (26 requirements) - Pending
- Phase 3: Contact Form (8 requirements) - Pending
- Phase 4: Authentication & Admin Panel (17 requirements) - Pending
- Phase 5: Design & Animations (8 requirements) - Pending
- Phase 6: SEO & Deployment (11 requirements) - Pending

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:** N/A (no completed phases yet)

**Cycle Times:**
- Planning → Execution: N/A
- Execution → Verification: N/A

**Quality Indicators:**
- Requirements coverage: 66/66 mapped (100%)
- Blocked requirements: 0
- Deferred scope: Automation phase (post-v1)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions Made

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2026-01-18 | Defer automation to post-v1 | Build and deploy site first, add Claude Code workflow after site is live |
| 2026-01-18 | Stack page shows planned diagrams only in v1 | Can't show live automation evidence before automation exists |
| 2026-01-18 | 6-phase structure with standard depth | Natural grouping of 66 requirements into coherent delivery boundaries |

### Active Todos

- [ ] Begin Phase 1 planning with `/gsd:plan-phase 1`

### Known Blockers

None currently.

### Research Notes

**From research/SUMMARY.md:**
- Next.js 16 + React 19 + TypeScript + Tailwind v4 stack is production-proven
- Critical pitfalls identified: infinite changelog loop, contact form spam, auth security theater, animation performance
- Research flags for later phases: WorkOS email allowlist (Phase 4), GitHub Actions changelog automation (post-v1)

## Session Continuity

**Quick Context for Next Session:**

You're working on an automated personal portfolio website. The roadmap is complete with 6 phases covering 66 requirements. The Stack/Automation page showcasing the automated workflow is the key differentiator.

**What Just Happened:**
- Created roadmap with 6 phases derived from requirements
- Validated 100% requirement coverage (66/66 mapped)
- Initialized STATE.md for project memory

**What's Next:**
Run `/gsd:plan-phase 1` to begin Foundation phase planning.

**Key Files:**
- `.planning/PROJECT.md` - Core value and constraints
- `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` - 66 v1 requirements with traceability
- `.planning/ROADMAP.md` - 6-phase delivery structure
- `.planning/research/SUMMARY.md` - Stack research and pitfall warnings
