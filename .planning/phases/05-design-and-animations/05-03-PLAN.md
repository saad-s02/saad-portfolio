Purpose: Transform static pages into engaging, animated experiences while maintaining accessibility and performance.

Output: All public pages have scroll-triggered animations that feel smooth and premium.

  <action>
Add scroll reveal animations to all Home page sections using FadeIn wrapper.

HeroSection.tsx (currently Server Component):
- Import FadeIn from @/components/animations/FadeIn
- Wrap the entire section content with &lt;FadeIn&gt;...&lt;/FadeIn&gt;
- No delay needed (above fold, animates on load)
- Component stays Server Component (FadeIn is client component doing the animation)

HighlightsSection.tsx (currently Server Component):
- Change from Server Component to "use client" (needs Framer Motion for list stagger)
- Import motion, useReducedMotion from framer-motion
- Keep existing structure but convert ul to motion.ul
- Add variants for stagger animation:
  ```typescript
  const containerVariants = {
    hidden: { opacity: 0 },
    visible: {
      opacity: 1,
      transition: { staggerChildren: 0.1 }
    }
  };
  const itemVariants = {
    hidden: { opacity: 0, x: -20 },
    visible: { opacity: 1, x: 0 }
  };
  ```
- motion.ul gets variants={containerVariants} initial="hidden" whileInView="visible" viewport={{ once: true }}
- Each motion.li gets variants={itemVariants}
- Wrap with useReducedMotion check (if true, return original static list)

Research reference: Lines 550-579 show staggered list pattern. This creates sequential reveal effect (100ms between each highlight).

AutomationTeaser.tsx:
- Import FadeIn from @/components/animations/FadeIn
- Wrap section content with &lt;FadeIn delay={0.2}&gt;...&lt;/FadeIn&gt;
- 200ms delay ensures it animates after highlights start

ContactCTA.tsx:
- Import FadeIn from @/components/animations/FadeIn
- Wrap section content with &lt;FadeIn delay={0.3}&gt;...&lt;/FadeIn&gt;
- 300ms delay creates sequential reveal from top to bottom

Why staggered delays on Home: Creates cohesive flow as user scrolls. Research (lines 406-444) warns against too many simultaneous animations.

Avoid: Wrapping FeaturedProjects (already has ProjectCard animations, don't double-animate).

npm run typecheck passes
npm run dev, scroll down Home page, verify:
- Hero fades in on load
- Highlights list items animate sequentially (100ms stagger)
- Automation section fades in after highlights
- Contact CTA fades in last
  </verify>
  <done>
All Home sections have scroll reveal animations with staggered timing for smooth sequential appearance.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Animate About page sections</name>
  <files>app/about/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
Add scroll reveals to About page with directional slides for strengths grid.

About page structure:
1. Narrative section (4 paragraphs)
2. Core Strengths section (2x2 grid)
3. Working with Engineering Managers callout

Implementation:
- Import FadeIn and SlideIn from @/components/animations
- Keep page as Server Component (animation wrappers are client components)

Narrative section:
- Wrap first section with &lt;FadeIn&gt;...&lt;/FadeIn&gt; (contains h1 and 4 paragraphs)

Core Strengths section:
- Wrap section h2 with &lt;FadeIn delay={0.1}&gt;...&lt;/FadeIn&gt;
- For the grid div (contains 4 strength cards):
  - Keep grid wrapper as-is
  - Wrap each individual strength div with &lt;SlideIn direction="left" delay={index * 0.1}&gt;
  - First card: delay={0}
  - Second card: delay={0.1}
  - Third card: delay={0.2}
  - Fourth card: delay={0.3}
- Stagger creates sequential left-slide effect (matches research pattern lines 550-579)

Engineering Managers callout:
- Wrap callout section with &lt;FadeIn delay={0.2}&gt;...&lt;/FadeIn&gt;

Why slide from left for strengths: Creates sense of building/constructing the grid. Direction matches reading flow (left-to-right).

Research reference: Lines 179-200 describe SlideIn pattern with directional options.
  </action>
  <verify>
npm run typecheck passes
npm run dev, navigate to /about, scroll down:
- Narrative section fades in
- "Core Strengths" heading fades in
- Four strength cards slide in from left sequentially (100ms stagger)
- Engineering Managers callout fades in
  </verify>
  <done>
About page has directional scroll reveals with strengths cards sliding in sequentially from left for engaging reveal effect.
  </done>

  <name>Task 3: Animate Stack and Resume pages</name>
  <files>
    app/stack/page.tsx
    app/resume/page.tsx
  </files>
  <action>
Add scroll reveals to Stack and Resume pages using FadeIn wrappers.

Stack page structure:
- Intro section (title + description)
- Architecture diagram (3-column grid)
- Automation pipeline (8-step workflow)

Stack page implementation:
- Import FadeIn from @/components/animations
- Keep as Server Component
- Wrap intro section with &lt;FadeIn&gt;
- Wrap architecture section with &lt;FadeIn delay={0.1}&gt;
- Wrap entire automation pipeline section with &lt;FadeIn delay={0.2}&gt;
- Note: Architecture grid and pipeline are already in bg-gray-900 containers, wrap the whole section (not individual items)

Why not animate each architecture column separately: Research (lines 399-444) warns about too many simultaneous animations. Grid is compact enough to animate as unit.

Resume page structure:
- Fetches data from Convex (async Server Component)
- Has empty state if no data
- Renders highlights, experience, education, skills sections

Resume page implementation:
- Import FadeIn from @/components/animations
- Keep as Server Component (fetchQuery is async)
- Wrap each major section with FadeIn:
  - Highlights section: &lt;FadeIn&gt;
  - Experience section: &lt;FadeIn delay={0.1}&gt;
  - Education section: &lt;FadeIn delay={0.2}&gt;
  - Skills section: &lt;FadeIn delay={0.3}&gt;
- If empty state shows, wrap that with &lt;FadeIn&gt; too

Sequential delays create top-to-bottom reveal as user scrolls resume.

Avoid: Animating individual experience items (would be 10+ simultaneous animations, causes jank per research).

Stack and Resume pages have scroll reveal animations on major sections, maintaining 50-100ms delays for smooth sequential appearance.

  <what-built>
All public pages (Home, About, Stack, Resume) now have scroll-triggered animations with accessibility support.

Animation additions:
- Home: Hero fade, highlights stagger, automation teaser fade, contact CTA fade
- About: Narrative fade, strengths slide-in from left (staggered), callout fade
- Stack: Intro fade, architecture fade, pipeline fade
- Resume: Section-by-section fade (highlights, experience, education, skills)
- All animations respect prefers-reduced-motion preference
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`

2. Test Home page (http://localhost:3000):
   - Scroll from top to bottom
   - Verify: Hero fades in on load
   - Verify: Highlights list items appear sequentially (one after another)
   - Verify: Automation section fades in
   - Verify: Contact CTA fades in last

3. Test About page (http://localhost:3000/about):
   - Scroll down slowly
   - Verify: Narrative section fades in
   - Verify: Four strength cards slide in from left (one at a time)
   - Verify: Engineering managers callout fades in

4. Test Stack page (http://localhost:3000/stack):
   - Scroll down
   - Verify: Architecture diagram fades in
   - Verify: Automation pipeline fades in

5. Test Resume page (http://localhost:3000/resume):
   - Scroll down
   - Verify: Each section (highlights, experience, education, skills) fades in sequentially

6. Test reduced motion accessibility:
   - macOS: System Settings → Accessibility → Display → Reduce motion ON
   - Windows: Settings → Accessibility → Visual effects → Animation effects OFF
   - Reload browser
   - Navigate through all pages - content should appear instantly with NO animations

7. Test page transitions:
   - Click between Home → About → Projects → Stack
   - Verify smooth fade-in on each navigation

8. Performance check:
   - Open Chrome DevTools → Performance
   - Record while scrolling Home page
   - Verify no frames over 16ms (jank)
   - Verify animations use transform/opacity only (check Layers panel)
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>
Type "approved" if animations feel smooth, accessible, and premium.
Describe issues if animations are janky, too fast/slow, or not respecting reduced motion.

1. Run typecheck: `npm run typecheck` - all pages compile
2. Run lint: `npm run lint` - no errors
3. Visual QA: Navigate to each page, scroll through, verify animations trigger at appropriate times
4. Accessibility: Enable reduced motion in OS settings, verify no animations play
5. Performance: Chrome DevTools Performance panel shows no jank (frames over 16ms)
6. Page transitions: Navigate between routes, verify smooth fade-in each time
